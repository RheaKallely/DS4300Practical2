Question: What is an AVL Tree?

AVL trees are an efficient data structure that is useful in many different types of applications. It is often used for sorting, searching, and other operations involving binary trees (i.e., trees whose nodes have values and are arranged so that each node has a left child and a right child). In this case, AVL stands for A Star Value Ladder - an approach to finding the k-th smallest element of an array using the A* search algorithm.

An AVL tree is a binary search tree where the minimum value (min_key) is always located at the leftmost node and the maximum value (max_key) is always located at the rightmost node. The key difference between AVL trees and other binary search trees lies in their way of balancing nodes during insertion, deletion, and searching operations.

In a typical AVL tree, each node has two child pointers - left and right children, whose values are either equal or different from the value of the parent node. When inserting a new node into the AVL tree, it is balanced by rotating its left subtree to the right until all the nodes in the left subtree are within the range of the current parent (i.e., their minimum keys and maximum keys are within the range of the current parent). This ensures that all subsequent insertions will be within the range of the parent, thus maintaining a balanced tree structure.

Searching an AVL node is also very efficient since it only needs to balance the nodes to find the target key. Searching in an AVL tree is O(log n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

In summary, AVL trees are a type of binary search tree that maintains a balanced structure during insertion and deletion operations. They have a linear search time complexity O(log n) and provide efficient solutions for many real-world applications involving sorting, searching, and other operations using binary trees.
