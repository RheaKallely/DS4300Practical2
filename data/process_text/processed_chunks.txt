legal one better height first tree called perfect binary tree smaller height second called degenerate tree two shapes represent two extremes best worst possible shapes binary search tree containing seven keys course small number keys like shape number keys grows distinction two tree shapes becomes increasingly vital whats degenerate shape isnt even necessarily rare edge case get start empty tree
